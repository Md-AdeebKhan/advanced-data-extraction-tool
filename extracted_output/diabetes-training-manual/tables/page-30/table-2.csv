"Monofilament test (contd) 
 
•  Apply the monofilament perpendicular to the skin surface. Apply sufficient 
force to cause the filament to bend or buckle. 
•  Press the filament to the skin and ask the patient whether they feel the 
pressure applied (Yes/No) 
•  Next, ask where they feel the pressure (right foot / left foot) 
•  Repeat this application twice at the same site but alternate this with one 
“mock” application in which no filament is applied 
• 
So, in total three questions per site should be asked",
