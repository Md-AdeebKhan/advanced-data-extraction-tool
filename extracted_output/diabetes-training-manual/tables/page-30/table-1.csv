"Foot problems in  diabetes 
 
•  Diabetic foot is one of the most common, costly 
and severe complications of diabetes 
• 
A diabetic foot ulcer is a localized injury to the 
skin and/or underlying tissue below the ankle. 
 
•  Most diabetic foot ulcers are most often caused 
by trauma from inappropriate footwear and/or 
walking barefoot with insensitive feet. 
 
• 
Combined with reduced blood flow, neuropathy 
in the feet increases the chance of foot ulcers, 
infection and eventual need for limb amputation.",,
