Diabetic nephropathy,Recommendations for early detection of
Definition,diabetic nephropathy
Diabetic nephropathy is aa clinical syndrome defined by albuminuria*,
,•  Control of glycaemia and blood pressure can slow the
"characterized by a relentless decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR),",
raised arterial blood pressure and high risk of CVD & death,progression of diabetic nephropathy.
Risk factors for kidney changes,•  Aim for good glycaemic control but adjust for hypoglycaemia risk
• genetic susceptibility,
,•  Once a year monitor the albumin/creatinine ratio in a spot urine
• poor glycaemic control,
,sample and serum creatinine for screening of CKD
• elevated blood pressure,
,"•  If measurement of the albumin/creatinine ratio is not available,"
Signs and symptoms of diabetic nephropathy,
,test for proteinuria (preferably with strips that specifically
"• The first symptom of diabetic nephropathy is usually peripheral edema,",
,measure lower concentrations of albumin).
but this occurs at a very late stage,
• The first clinical sign of diabetic nephropathy is moderately increased,•  Maintain blood pressure levels at <130/80 mmHg with a thiazide
"urine albumin excretion (microalbuminuria: 30–300 mg/24 h, or an",diuretic and an ACE-inhibitor
albumin/creatinine ratio 30–300 mg/g).,
"*(albuminuria in at least 2 of 3 consecutive samples > 300 mg/24 h, or","•  Modify other major CVD risk factors (dyslipidaemia, smoking)"
albumin/creatinine ratio of> 300 mg/g),
