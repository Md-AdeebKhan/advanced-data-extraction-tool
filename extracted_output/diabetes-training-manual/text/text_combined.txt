DIABETES 
What is diabetes? 
A group of metabolic disorders characterized by the presence of hyperglycaemia in the absence of 
treatment. The aetio-pathology includes defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both 
The long-term specific complications of diabetes include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy 
Steps for management of diabetes in a primary care setting 
ASSESS

Risk factors for type 2 diabetes (strong): 
• overweight/obesity 
• physical inactivity 
• diabetes in first degree relatives 
• history of gestational diabetes 
• cardiovascular disease and its risk factors 
• ethnicity (South Asian, Afro-Caribbean, Hispanic) 
Risk factors for type 1 diabetes (weak): 
• Certain genetic haplotypes 
• Unknown environmental factors 
Risk factors for gestational diabetes (strong) 
• Similar to type 2 diabetes 
Symptoms

=6.5% 
 
Treatment goal 
HbA1c < 7% is generally considered to be adequate glycaemic control. If not available, fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG<7.0mmol/l or <125 mg/dl) 
 
Pharmacological treatment 
Metformin is recommended as the first-line medicine in the treatment of diabetes. Sulfonylurea is 
recommended as the second-line treatment, and human insulin as the third-line treatment. 
 
Control of blood pressure and blood lipids 
Hypertension treatment is indicated when SBP ≥130 and/or DBP ≥80. Statins are recommended for 
all people with type 2 diabetes older than 40 years, but only if this does not negatively impact access 
to glucose-lowering and blood pressure - lowering medication. 
 
FOLLOWUP 
Monitoring glycaemic control 
 
o When diabetes is diagnosed, monitor glycaemic control every three months until diabetes is 
controlled, then every six months after that. 
 
o HbA1c is the most accurate measurement of long-term glycaemic control and represents the 
average blood glucose over the previous two to three months. HbA1c < 7% is generally considered 
to be adequate glycaemic control. In people with frequent severe hypoglycaemia, severe 
complications and low life-expectancy, the goal for HbA1c could be relaxed, e.g. to<8%. 
 
o Fasting plasma glucose (FPG<7.0mmol/l or <125 mg/dl) can also be used to monitor control 
when HbA1c testing is not available.

Acute complications of Diabetes 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA 
Hypoglycaemia (abnormally low blood glucose) is a frequent iatrogenic complication in diabetic patients, 
occurring particularly in patients receiving sulfonylurea or insulin. It can cause loss of consciousness and 
coma and is potentially life-threatening. 
There is no universally agreed plasma glucose cut-off point for hypoglycaemia as symptoms and signs 
can occur at different thresholds. It is most frequently defined at plasma glucose of <3.9 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) 
when it should be managed even if there are no symptoms and signs. 
Management of hypolycaemic emergencies 
Conscious patient: 
If the patient is able to eat and drink: 
• Give oral carbohydrate that contains 15-20 g of rapidly absorbing forms of glucose 
(sugar-sweetened soft drink, 1-2 teaspoons of sugar, 5-6 hard candy, cup of milk). 
• Plasma glucose levels typically increase by 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) within ~15 minutes; repeat the 
treatment if hypoglycaemia persists 
Unconscious patient: 
• Unconscious patients, those with plasma glucose <=2.8mmol/l (50mg/dl) and those unable to 
ingest drink should be given hypertonic glucose (dextrose) intravenously (20 – 50 ml of 50% 
glucose over 1-3 minutes. If this concentration is not available, substitute with any hypertonic 
glucose solution 
• Food should be provided as soon as the patient is able to ingest food safely 
• Discuss hypoglycaemia risk factors with the patient (skipping meals, physical activity more 
intense than usual, alcohol ingestion) and adjust medication if necessary 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA 
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) are life-threatening 
conditions with somewhat different features. 
Symptoms and signs of DKA and HHS 
• frequent symptoms of DKA are nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain 
• Severe cases of DKA can present with Kussmaul's breathing 
• Changes in sensorium in DKA range from alertness to stupor or coma, depending on the severity 
• Patients with HHS typically present in stupor or coma 
Management of hyperglycaemia in primary health care 


--- Page 6 ---
• DKA or HHS should be suspected in every ill patient with hyperglycaemia 
 
• Refer to hospital all patients with plasma glucose levels >= 18 mmol/l (325 mg/dl) and all patients 
with suspected DKA or HHS 
 
• Correction of dehydration is the critical first step for transport. Hyperglycaemia slows gastric 
emptying and oral rehydration might not be effective, even in patients who are not vomiting 
• Hyperglycaemic emergencies should be managed in hospital by correction of dehydration 
• electrolyte disbalance and administration of insulin 
 
Chronic complications 
Chronic complications of Diabetes are: 
 
Diabetic eye disease (Diabetic retinopathy) 
People with type 2 diabetes should be screened for retinopathy by a trained person upon diagnosis and 
biennially thereafter, or as per recommendations of the ophthalmologist: 
o Visual acuity 
o Direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy or retinal fundus photography, after dilating the pupils 
· 
• Patients reporting vision loss at any visit and those who have not had a retinal exam in more than 
2 years should be referred to an ophthalmologist. 
 
Diabetic kidney disease (Diabetic nephropathy) 
• Monitor the albumin/creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample and serum creatinine (for calculation 
of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) once a year. 
 
• CKD is defined by GFR<OR the presence of moderate or severe albuminuria (albumin-creatinine ratio 
≥30 mg/mmol). 
 
• If measurement of the albumin/creatinine ratio is not available, test for proteinuria (preferably 
with strips that specifically measure lower concentrations of albumin). 
 
• Refer for specialist assessment all patients with proteinuria, those with moderate albuminuria 
and those with GFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m
2
 
Diabetic neuropathy 
Nerve damage or degeneration in diabetes is a group of disorders with diverse clinical manifestations 
like sensory and disorders of autonomic nervous system. 
 
• Risk factors are duration of diabetes, poor glycaemic control, advancing age, hypertension, obesity 
• Common symptoms are Sensory loss, unpleasant sensation of burning, pain, tingling or numbness 


--- Page 7 ---
• Control of glycaemia and blood pressure can slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy. 
• Specific treatment for the underlying nerve damage is not available 
Diabetic foot 
Patients can present with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and or peripheral artery occlusion. 
The absence of symptoms does not exclude diabetic foot problems. 
Examination 
All people with diabetes should have their feet examined at least once a year to assess risk. 
1. Examination of the feet for the following risk factors after removing the patient's shoes, socks, 
dressings and bandages: 
• Peripheral neuropathy 
- Pressure perception testing with 10g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament 
At least one other test of sensation (128Hz tuning fork vibration / cotton wisp /pin prick) and Achilles 
tendon reflexes 
• Peripheral arterial disease 
- Palpation of tibial posterior and dorsal pedal artery pulse, 
- Doppler ankle/brachial pressure index and toe-brachial pressure index if available 
• Presence of current or previous (healed) ulcer 
• Previous amputation 
• Presence of callus 
• Presence of deformity: claw toes, hammer toes, bony prominences; limited joint mobility 
• Presence of Charcot arthropathy: redness, warmth, swelling or deformity, particularly if skin is 
intact 
• Signs of infection or inflammation: at least two of redness, warmth, induration, tenderness, 
purulent secretion 
• Signs of gangrene 
 
Management of risk of diabetic foot problems 
• Patients with diabetes should receive education on avoidance of foot complications 
• Patients at low risk can be assessed annually, those at moderate risk every 3-6 months and those 
at high risk every 1-3 months 
• Pre-ulcerative lesions need to be treated by a trained professional: removal of callus, protecting or 
draining blisters, treatment of ingrown and thickened nails, antifungal treatment for fungal infections 
• Patients with gross foot deformities and/or absent peripheral pulses should be referred for further 
evaluation.

Management of active diabetic foot problems 
• Active foot problems require referral to a higher level of care. Best results in prevention of 
amputations have been achieved in settings with a multidisciplinary. 
• Patients with a foot ulcer should be referred to a more specialized level for further evaluation if 
management by a trained professional and the necessary equipment and consumables are not 
available at the primary care level 
 
• Urgent referral to acute services is recommended for patients with any of the following: infected 
ulcer, spreading infection, critical limb ischaemia, gangrene, suspicion of acute Charcot arthropathy, 
unexplained red swollen foot

present. Thyroid examination unremarkable. Tongue appears dry and coated. 
 
What biochemical tests would you want to do next in the primary care setting? 
• Fasting or random PG 
• Urine nitrites, protein, leukocytes, blood (infection) 
• Urine glucose and ketones 
• Blood film, haemoglobin and hematocrite , if available 
• HIV 
 
Results are as follows: Blood film, haemoglobin and haematocrit are within normal limits. 
FBG 20.0mmol/L. Urine glucose +++, Ketones +++, HIV negative 
 
What is your provisional diagnosis? 
First presentation of type 1 diabetes, probable ketoacidosis 
 
How do you proceed? 
 
• I.V. drip of 0.9% NaCl (1 litre in first 2 hours, continue at 1 litre every 4 hours) 
• Urgent referral to hospital 
• If available: short-acting (regular) insulin can be administered s.c. or i.m. (0.15 – 2 I.U. per kg 
body weight) 
 
Case Study 6 - Diabetic Foot (2) 
K.L. is a 60-year-old female who presents with a black 2
nd toe on her left foot. She was diagnosed with 
T2DM 3 years ago and is currently on simvastatin 40mg daily, metformin 1g daily. She says she first 
noticed the black toe a couple of weeks ago but has since come in because she has noticed that there 
is a deep ulcer at the tip of her 2
nd toe. She currently smokes 20 cigarettes per day. She has not been 
reviewed since time of diagnosis. 
 
What is your differential diagnosis? 
Peripheral vascular disease and peripheral neuropathy secondary to poorly controlled diabetes 
 
What do you want to know? 
History 
• Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling) 
• Symptoms of peripheral vascular occlusion (intermittent claudication) 
• Symptoms of other complications: redness, swelling, tingling or weakness 
• Systemic symptoms of infection e.g. chills, rigors, fever 


--- Page 21 ---
• Compliance and side effects of medications 
• Smoking, diet, exercise 
 
What do you want to look for? 
Physical examination 
• Blood pressure 
• Peripheral pulses 
• Neurological lower limb exam (particularly looking for Charcot's, monofilament, tuning fork, reflexes) 
Biochemical tests 
• Fasting PG (HbA1C if available) 
• Urine protein dipstick (or urine albumin/creatinine ratio and serum creatinine if available) 
• Urine glucose and ketones 
 
On examination, K.L.'s random PG is 20mmol/l. Her blood pressure is 160/95. Examination shows that 
in her left foot, there is an absent dorsalis pedis pulse and a weak posterior tibial pulse. The tip of her 2
nd 
toe in the left foot is black with a 1cm x 1cm x 1cm ulcer with clean edges. There is no surrounding 
erythema or swelling. 
Urinalysis shows protein 2+, ketones 0. 
How would you proceed? 
 
• Refer urgently to hospital for surgical admission for suspected gangrene (probable need for toe 
amputation and angioplasty if available) 
• In referral papers indicate suspected renal impairment and need for eye exam and blood pressure 
and plasma glucose control 
 
 
Case Study 7 – Accidental diagnosis of diabetes in a young person 
M.N. is a thin, 25-year-old male who presents with a fever and a dry cough of 3 days duration. 
You diagnose pneumonia on lung auscultation and elevated leucocyte count and initiate antibiotic 
treatment. 
Random plasma glucose has also been measured and it is 12.4 mmol/l. 
What do you do next? 
 
History 
• Ask about symptoms of diabetes (weight loss, thirst, frequent urination) 
 
Biochemical tests 
• Urine glucose and ketones 
 
M.N. denies having symptoms of diabetes and was well before the onset of fever and cough. 
Urine glucose is +++, urine ketones ++ 
How do you proceed? 
 
The plasma and urine glucose values are diagnostic of diabetes. However, plasma glucose is sometimes 
elevated in infectious diseases. Urine ketones could be positive because of incipient diabetic ketoacidosis, 
or because the patient has eaten little since his illness started 


--- Page 22 ---
• Give the patient counselling on a healthy diet and advise plentiful oral rehydration with water 
• Ask the patient to come in 3-4 days, fasting. 
 
M.N. comes back feeling better, the fever has subsided, and he has no symptoms of 
diabetes. Fasting PG is 8.0 mmol/l, urine glucose is ++, ketones + 
How do you proceed? 
 
• Continue pneumonia treatment as planned 
• You can either: 
- Refer the patient to a higher level of care on suspicion of evolving type 1 diabetes 
- Measure fasting plasma glucose again in a week, alerting the patient to come immediately 
if diabetes symptoms occur; refer to a higher level if diabetic FPG values persist.

What is diabetes ? 
 
• Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders 
characterized by the presence of hyperglycaemia in 
the absence of treatment. 
• Diabetes occurs either when the pancreas does not 
produce enough insulin or when the body cannot 
effectively use the insulin it produces 
• The long-term specific complications of diabetes 
include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy 
  
Types of diabetes 
 
• Type 1 diabetes 
• characterized by deficient insulin production 
• requires daily administration of insulin for survival 
• Type 2 diabetes 
• The most common type of diabetes (>90%) 
• Combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate 
insulin secretory response due to ß-cell dysfunction. 
• Insulin is not required for survival, but often needed it for 
controlling blood glucose levels. 
• Gestational diabetes 
• Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values 
above normal but below those diagnostics of diabetes, occurring 
during pregnancy.

Whom to test? 
(According to WHO Diabetes protocol 2018) 
In asymptomatic people, it is recommended to repeat 
testing to confirm the diagnosis, preferably with the same 
test, as soon as practicable on a subsequent day 
Management of Raised blood sugar 
Management in presence of Ketones 
  
Precautions with antidiabetic drugs 
 
Metformin is contraindicated in 
• people with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) <45 ml/minute/1.73m2) 
• liver disease 
• cardiac/respiratory insufficiency 
• alcohol abuse 
• history of lactic acidosis 
Glibenclamide is not recommended in 
• people aged 60 years or older 
• In patients for whom hypoglycaemia is a concern (people who are at 
risk of falls, people who have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, 
people who live alone) 
• people who drive or operate machinery as part of their job 
  
Macrovascular complications 
 
Patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of 
• Coronary heart disease 
• Cerebrovascular disease 
• Peripheral vascular diseases 
Management of CVD risk factors 
in diabetes (hypertension) 
Blood pressure control 
• Blood pressure lowering in people with diabetes reduces 
the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications 
• Thiazide diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors are recommended 
• Target should be to achieve a target blood pressure < 
130/80 mmHg. 
• If this is not achievable, refer to a higher level of care. 


--- Page 28 ---
 
 
 
 
 
Management of CVD risk factors 
in diabetes (lipid control) 
Lipid control 
• Some lipid profile improvement can be achieved with a 
healthy diet and physical activity. 
• Statins can reduce the risk of CVD events in people with 
diabetes. 
Antiplatelet treatment 
• Use of antiplatelet treatment only for secondary prevention 
of CVD events. 
• 75-100 mg of acetylsalicylic acid daily is recommended to all 
people with diabetes who have survived a CVD event and 
have no history of major bleeding 
Acute complications 
of diabetes 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia 
 
 
 
If the patient is able to eat and drink: •
 Give oral carbohydrate that contains 15-20 g of rapidly 
absorbing forms of glucose (sugar-sweetened soft drink, 1-2 
teaspoons of sugar, 5-6 hard candy, cup of milk) •
 Repeat the treatment if hypoglycaemia persists after 15 
minutes •
 If rapidly absorbing glucose is not available, any foods 
containing carbohydrate can be given (e.g. bread, rice, potato) •
 Follow by a small meal 
Management of hypoglycaemia – 
conscious patient 
  
Hypoglycaemia 
 
• Hypoglycaemia (abnormally low blood glucose) is a frequent 
complication in patients receiving sulfonylurea or insulin. 
• There is no universally agreed plasma glucose cut-off point for 
hypoglycaemia as symptoms and signs can occur at different 
thresholds. 
• It is most frequently defined at plasma glucose of <3.9 
mmol/l (70 mg/dl) when it should be managed even if there 
are no symptoms and signs. 
• Severe hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose <50 mg/dl or 2.8 
mmol/l) or appearance of signs 
• It can cause loss of consciousness and coma and is potentially 
life-threatening 
Management of hypoglycaemia- 
unconscious patient 
If patient is Unconscious, 
• If plasma glucose <=2.8mmol/l (50mg/dl ) and those unable 
to eat or ingest drink – give hypertonic glucose (dextrose) 
intravenously (20 – 50 ml of 50% glucose over 1-3 minutes. 
• If this concentration is not available, substitute with any 
hypertonic glucose solution 
• Food should be provided as soon as the patient is able to 
ingest food safely 
• Adjust medication if necessary 
• Educate the patient about conditions leading to hypoglycaemia 
  
Hyperglycaemic emergencies 
 
• Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar 
hyperglycaemic state (HHS) are life-threatening 
conditions 
• Severe hyperglycaemia- 
• Plasma glucose >18 mmol/l (325 mg/dl) and 
• Urine ketone 2+ or signs and 
• Symptoms of severe hyperglycaemia 
Symptoms and signs of 
hyperglycaemia (DKA and HHS) 
• Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain 
• Severe cases of DKA can present with Kussmaul’s 
breathing* 
• Changes in sensorium range from alertness to stupor or 
coma, depending on the severity 
• Patients with HHS typically present in stupor or coma 
*Kussmaul breathing: Air hunger, or rapid, deep, and 
labored breathing characteristic of patients with 
acidosis 


--- Page 29 ---
 
 
 
 
 
Management of hyperglycaemic 
emergencies 
• DKA or HHS should be suspected in every ill patient with 
hyperglycaemia 
• Refer to hospital all patients with plasma glucose levels >= 
18 mmol/l (325 mg/dl) and all patients with suspected DKA 
or HHS 
• Infuse isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) at a rate of 1000 ml in 
the first 2 hours, continue with 1000ml every 4 hours until 
reaching hospital. 
• Hyperglycaemia slows gastric emptying and oral 
rehydration might not be effective, even in patients who 
are not vomiting 
  Correction of dehydration is the critical first step for transport.  
Specific Long- term 
Complications of Diabetes 
• Diabetic retinopathy 
• Diabetic nephropathy 
• Diabetic neuropathy 
• Diabetic foot 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Autonomic neuropathy 
• Sensory loss 
• Unpleasant sensation of 
burning, pain 
• Tingling or numbness 
• Hypoglycaemia 
• Orthostatic hypotension 
• Resting tachycardia 
• Diarrhoea, constipation and fecal 
incontinence 
• 
Erectile dysfunction 
• Urinary incontinence and bladder 
dysfunction 
Recommendations for early detection of 
diabetic retinopathy 
• Good control of glycaemia as well as blood pressure and 
dyslipidaemia can slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy and 
macular edema 
• People with type 2 diabetes should be screened for retinopathy by a 
trained person upon diagnosis and every 2 years thereafter 
• Visual acuity 
• Direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy or retinal fundus photography, 
after dilating the pupils 
• Patients reporting vision loss at any visit and those who have not had 
a retinal exam in more than 2 years should be referred to an 
ophthalmologist. 
• Referral to an ophthalmologist is recommended if screening by a 
trained person is not available in primary care 
  
Diabetic nephropathy 
 
Definition 
Diabetic nephropathy is aa clinical syndrome defined by albuminuria* 
characterized by a relentless decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 
raised arterial blood pressure and high risk of CVD & death 
Risk factors for kidney changes 
• genetic susceptibility 
• poor glycaemic control 
• elevated blood pressure 
Signs and symptoms of diabetic nephropathy 
• The first symptom of diabetic nephropathy is usually peripheral edema, 
but this occurs at a very late stage 
• The first clinical sign of diabetic nephropathy is moderately increased 
urine albumin excretion (microalbuminuria: 30–300 mg/24 h, or an 
albumin/creatinine ratio 30–300 mg/g). 
*(albuminuria in at least 2 of 3 consecutive samples > 300 mg/24 h, or 
albumin/creatinine ratio of> 300 mg/g) 
Recommendations for early detection of 
diabetic nephropathy 
• Control of glycaemia and blood pressure can slow the 
progression of diabetic nephropathy. 
• Aim for good glycaemic control but adjust for hypoglycaemia risk 
• Once a year monitor the albumin/creatinine ratio in a spot urine 
sample and serum creatinine for screening of CKD 
• If measurement of the albumin/creatinine ratio is not available, 
test for proteinuria (preferably with strips that specifically 
measure lower concentrations of albumin). 
• Maintain blood pressure levels at <130/80 mmHg with a thiazide 
diuretic and an ACE-inhibitor 
• Modify other major CVD risk factors (dyslipidaemia, smoking) 
  
Diabetic neuropathy 
 
Definition 
• Nerve damage or degeneration in diabetes is a group of disorders with diverse 
clinical manifestations like sensory and disorders of autonomic nervous system. 
Risk factors 
• Duration of diabetes, Poor glycaemic control 
• Age, Hypertension , Obesity 
Signs and symptoms of diabetic neuropathy 
Recommendations for management of diabetic 
neuropathy 
• Specific treatment for the underlying nerve damage is not 
available 
• If possible, exclude causes of peripheral neuropathy other 
than diabetes (alcohol, chemotherapy, vitamin B12 
deficiency, hypothyroidism, renal disease, malignancies, HIV 
infection) 
• Refer patients with painful peripheral neuropathy to 
specialized care for pharmacological management of pain 
• Refer patients with suspected autonomic neuropathy to 
specialized care 
• Improve glycaemic and blood pressure control

Foot problems in diabetes 
 
• Diabetic foot is one of the most common, costly 
and severe complications of diabetes 
• A diabetic foot ulcer is a localized injury to the 
skin and/or underlying tissue below the ankle. 
• Most diabetic foot ulcers are most often caused 
by trauma from inappropriate footwear and/or 
walking barefoot with insensitive feet. 
• Combined with reduced blood flow, neuropathy 
in the feet increases the chance of foot ulcers, 
infection and eventual need for limb amputation. 
 Symptoms of diabetic foot 
 
• Patients can present with symptoms and signs of 
peripheral neuropathy and/or peripheral artery 
occlusion and other risk factors for amputation 
• Symptoms are: 
• Intermittent claudication - pain in calves when walking, 
usually disappears in rest (occlusion in peripheral 
arteries) 
• symptoms of neuropathy 
The absence of symptoms does not exclude 
diabetic foot problems. 
Assessment and management of risk of active 
foot problems 
Examination of the feet 
• Remove the patient’s shoes, socks, dressings and 
bandages 
• Check for Peripheral neuropathy - 
• Pressure perception testing with 10g Semmes- 
Weinstein monofilament and 
• At least one other test of sensation ( 128Hz tuning fork 
vibration / cotton wisp /pin prick – see images) and 
• Achilles tendon reflexes 
  
Monofilament test 
 
Sensory examination should be carried out in a quiet and 
relaxed setting. 
Figure a: 
• First apply the monofilament on the patient’s hands (or 
elbow or forehead) so that she or he knows what to 
Sites for 
expect. 
monofilament test 
• The patient must not be able to see whether or where 
the examiner applies the filament. 
• The three sites to be tested on both feet are indicated in 
Figure 
• The total duration– skin contact and removal of the 
filament should be approx. 2 secs. 
• Apply the filament along the perimeter of not on an 
ulcer site callus or necrotic tissue. 
• Do not allow the filament to slide across the skin or make 
repetitive contact at the test site. 
  
Monofilament test (contd) 
 
• Apply the monofilament perpendicular to the skin surface. Apply sufficient 
force to cause the filament to bend or buckle. 
• Press the filament to the skin and ask the patient whether they feel the 
pressure applied (Yes/No) 
• Next, ask where they feel the pressure (right foot / left foot) 
• Repeat this application twice at the same site but alternate this with one 
“mock” application in which no filament is applied 
• So, in total three questions per site should be asked 
  
Palpation of arteries 
 
Palpation of dorsal pedis: 
• Feel in the middle of the dorsum of 
the foot just lateral to the tendon of 
extensor halluces longus (extensor 
tendon of the great toe) 
Posterior tibial artery: 
• Midway between medial malleolus 
and tendon calcaneus

• Patients with gross foot deformities and/or absent 
peripheral pulses should be referred for further evaluation. 
  
Counselling on foot care 
 
✓ Examine the feet daily, including between the toes 
✓ Avoid walking barefoot, in thin-soled footwear or in socks only, both at 
home and outside 
✓ Wash feet daily with water temperature below 37°C and dry them well, 
especially between the toes 
✓ Lubricate skin with emollients, but not between the toes 
✓ Cut toenails straight across. 
✓ Wear socks without seams, not wear tight or knee-high sock and change 
socks daily 
✓ Not wear shoes that are too tight, have rough edges or uneven seams; the 
inside should be 1-2 cm longer than the foot 
✓ Inspect shoes inside before putting them on 
✓ Not remove corns and calluses, including with chemical agents or plasters 
 Points to remember .. 
 
• Adults who are symptomatic can be tested with FPG or RPG 
(if they present in a non-fasting state) 
• Fasting (venous or capillary) plasma glucose =7.0 mmol/l OR 
=126 mg/dl is diagnostic of diabetes 
• Adults who are asymptomatic, should be tested with FPG 
• If plasma glucose >= 18 mmol/l (325 mg/dl) urine ketones 
should be measured 
• Metformin is the recommended initial pharmacological 
treatment. 
• Target for glycaemic control is 
• HbA1c of 7.0% or, 
• FPG value of 7.0 mmol/l (126mg/dl) and ( if feasible) a postprandial 
PG value of 9.0mmol/l (160 mg/dl) 
Activities & case studies 
How to use blood glucose meter 
 
• Requirements for testing 
o Blood glucose meter 
o Lancet 
o Test strips 
• Step 1 : Prick the middle or ring finger 
• Step 2 : Apply blood to strip 
• Step 3 : Read the result : Meter will display the blood glucose level. 
• Precautions 
o Participant has to be in a fasting state for at least eight hours 
(participant can have water in fasting period but not tea or coffee) 
o Do not squeeze the finger take blood 
o Check the expiry date of test strips

• 
 Case study 2: Poorly controlled diabetic 
 
1. C.D. a 60 year- old male was diagnosed with T2DM 2 years 
ago. He is currently on metformin 2g daily and come to the 
PHC for a check-up after 12 months. What do you do? 
2. C.D. states that he has gained 4 kg over the past 6 months. 
He says that he has to wake up several times in the middle of 
the night to pass urine. He reports he is compliant with his 
metformin and has not experienced any side effects. He had

Accidental diagnosis of diabetes in a young person 
• M.N. is a thin, 25-year-old male who presents with a fever and 
a dry cough of 3 days duration. You diagnose pneumonia on 
lung auscultation and elevated leucocyte count and initiate 
antibiotic treatment. 
• Random plasma glucose has also been measured and it is 12.4 
mmol/l. What do you do next? 
• M.N. denies having symptoms of diabetes and was well before the
