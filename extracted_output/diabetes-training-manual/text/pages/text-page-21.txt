• Compliance and side effects of medications 
• Smoking, diet, exercise 
 
What do you want to look for? 
Physical examination 
• Blood pressure 
• Peripheral pulses 
• Neurological lower limb exam (particularly looking for Charcot's, monofilament, tuning fork, reflexes) 
Biochemical tests 
• Fasting PG (HbA1C if available) 
• Urine protein dipstick (or urine albumin/creatinine ratio and serum creatinine if available) 
• Urine glucose and ketones 
 
On examination, K.L.'s random PG is 20mmol/l. Her blood pressure is 160/95. Examination shows that 
in her left foot, there is an absent dorsalis pedis pulse and a weak posterior tibial pulse. The tip of her 2
nd 
toe in the left foot is black with a 1cm x 1cm x 1cm ulcer with clean edges. There is no surrounding 
erythema or swelling. 
Urinalysis shows protein 2+, ketones 0. 
How would you proceed? 
 
• Refer urgently to hospital for surgical admission for suspected gangrene (probable need for toe 
amputation and angioplasty if available) 
• In referral papers indicate suspected renal impairment and need for eye exam and blood pressure 
and plasma glucose control 
 
 
Case Study 7 – Accidental diagnosis of diabetes in a young person 
M.N. is a thin, 25-year-old male who presents with a fever and a dry cough of 3 days duration. 
You diagnose pneumonia on lung auscultation and elevated leucocyte count and initiate antibiotic 
treatment. 
Random plasma glucose has also been measured and it is 12.4 mmol/l. 
What do you do next? 
 
History 
• Ask about symptoms of diabetes (weight loss, thirst, frequent urination) 
 
Biochemical tests 
• Urine glucose and ketones 
 
M.N. denies having symptoms of diabetes and was well before the onset of fever and cough. 
Urine glucose is +++, urine ketones ++ 
How do you proceed? 
 
The plasma and urine glucose values are diagnostic of diabetes. However, plasma glucose is sometimes 
elevated in infectious diseases. Urine ketones could be positive because of incipient diabetic ketoacidosis, 
or because the patient has eaten little since his illness started
