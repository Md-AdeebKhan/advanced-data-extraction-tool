Urgent referral 
Recommended actions for 
foot deformities 
• Removal of callus (or refer if not feasible) 
• Protecting or draining blisters 
• Treatment of ingrown and thickened nails (or refer if not 
feasible) 
• Antifungal treatment for fungal infections 
• Patients with gross foot deformities and/or absent 
peripheral pulses should be referred for further evaluation. 
  
Counselling on foot care 
 
✓ Examine the feet daily, including between the toes 
✓ Avoid walking barefoot, in thin-soled footwear or in socks only, both at 
home and outside 
✓ Wash feet daily with water temperature below 37°C and dry them well, 
especially between the toes 
✓ Lubricate skin with emollients, but not between the toes 
✓ Cut toenails straight across. 
✓ Wear socks without seams, not wear tight or knee-high sock and change 
socks daily 
✓ Not wear shoes that are too tight, have rough edges or uneven seams; the 
inside should be 1-2 cm longer than the foot 
✓ Inspect shoes inside before putting them on 
✓ Not remove corns and calluses, including with chemical agents or plasters 
 Points to remember .. 
 
• Adults who are symptomatic can be tested with FPG or RPG 
(if they present in a non-fasting state) 
• Fasting (venous or capillary) plasma glucose =7.0 mmol/l OR 
=126 mg/dl is diagnostic of diabetes 
• Adults who are asymptomatic, should be tested with FPG 
• If plasma glucose >= 18 mmol/l (325 mg/dl) urine ketones 
should be measured 
• Metformin is the recommended initial pharmacological 
treatment. 
• Target for glycaemic control is 
• HbA1c of 7.0% or, 
• FPG value of 7.0 mmol/l (126mg/dl) and ( if feasible) a postprandial 
PG value of 9.0mmol/l (160 mg/dl) 
Activities & case studies 
How to use blood glucose meter 
 
• Requirements for testing 
o Blood glucose meter 
o Lancet 
o Test strips 
• Step 1 : Prick the middle or ring finger 
• Step 2 : Apply blood to strip 
• Step 3 : Read the result : Meter will display the blood glucose level. 
• Precautions 
o Participant has to be in a fasting state for at least eight hours 
(participant can have water in fasting period but not tea or coffee) 
o Do not squeeze the finger take blood 
o Check the expiry date of test strips
