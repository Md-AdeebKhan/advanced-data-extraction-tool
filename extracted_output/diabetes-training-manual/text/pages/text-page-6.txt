• DKA or HHS should be suspected in every ill patient with hyperglycaemia 
 
• Refer to hospital all patients with plasma glucose levels >= 18 mmol/l (325 mg/dl) and all patients 
with suspected DKA or HHS 
 
• Correction of dehydration is the critical first step for transport. Hyperglycaemia slows gastric 
emptying and oral rehydration might not be effective, even in patients who are not vomiting 
• Hyperglycaemic emergencies should be managed in hospital by correction of dehydration 
• electrolyte disbalance and administration of insulin 
 
Chronic complications 
Chronic complications of Diabetes are: 
 
Diabetic eye disease (Diabetic retinopathy) 
People with type 2 diabetes should be screened for retinopathy by a trained person upon diagnosis and 
biennially thereafter, or as per recommendations of the ophthalmologist: 
o Visual acuity 
o Direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy or retinal fundus photography, after dilating the pupils 
· 
• Patients reporting vision loss at any visit and those who have not had a retinal exam in more than 
2 years should be referred to an ophthalmologist. 
 
Diabetic kidney disease (Diabetic nephropathy) 
• Monitor the albumin/creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample and serum creatinine (for calculation 
of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) once a year. 
 
• CKD is defined by GFR<OR the presence of moderate or severe albuminuria (albumin-creatinine ratio 
≥30 mg/mmol). 
 
• If measurement of the albumin/creatinine ratio is not available, test for proteinuria (preferably 
with strips that specifically measure lower concentrations of albumin). 
 
• Refer for specialist assessment all patients with proteinuria, those with moderate albuminuria 
and those with GFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m

Diabetic neuropathy 
Nerve damage or degeneration in diabetes is a group of disorders with diverse clinical manifestations 
like sensory and disorders of autonomic nervous system. 
 
• Risk factors are duration of diabetes, poor glycaemic control, advancing age, hypertension, obesity 
• Common symptoms are Sensory loss, unpleasant sensation of burning, pain, tingling or numbness
