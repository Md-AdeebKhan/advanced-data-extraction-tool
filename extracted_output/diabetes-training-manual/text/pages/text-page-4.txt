Treatment goal 
HbA1c < 7% is generally considered to be adequate glycaemic control. If not available, fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG<7.0mmol/l or <125 mg/dl) 
 
Pharmacological treatment 
Metformin is recommended as the first-line medicine in the treatment of diabetes. Sulfonylurea is 
recommended as the second-line treatment, and human insulin as the third-line treatment. 
 
Control of blood pressure and blood lipids 
Hypertension treatment is indicated when SBP ≥130 and/or DBP ≥80. Statins are recommended for 
all people with type 2 diabetes older than 40 years, but only if this does not negatively impact access 
to glucose-lowering and blood pressure - lowering medication. 
 
FOLLOWUP 
Monitoring glycaemic control 
 
o When diabetes is diagnosed, monitor glycaemic control every three months until diabetes is 
controlled, then every six months after that. 
 
o HbA1c is the most accurate measurement of long-term glycaemic control and represents the 
average blood glucose over the previous two to three months. HbA1c < 7% is generally considered 
to be adequate glycaemic control. In people with frequent severe hypoglycaemia, severe 
complications and low life-expectancy, the goal for HbA1c could be relaxed, e.g. to<8%. 
 
o Fasting plasma glucose (FPG<7.0mmol/l or <125 mg/dl) can also be used to monitor control 
when HbA1c testing is not available.
