What is diabetes ? 
 
• Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders 
characterized by the presence of hyperglycaemia in 
the absence of treatment. 
• Diabetes occurs either when the pancreas does not 
produce enough insulin or when the body cannot 
effectively use the insulin it produces 
• The long-term specific complications of diabetes 
include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy 
  
Types of diabetes 
 
• Type 1 diabetes 
• characterized by deficient insulin production 
• requires daily administration of insulin for survival 
• Type 2 diabetes 
• The most common type of diabetes (>90%) 
• Combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate 
insulin secretory response due to ß-cell dysfunction. 
• Insulin is not required for survival, but often needed it for 
controlling blood glucose levels. 
• Gestational diabetes 
• Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values 
above normal but below those diagnostics of diabetes, occurring 
during pregnancy.

Diagnostic criteria for diabetes 
*overnight fast of 8-14 hours; **if laboratory measurement is not available, point of care devices can be used 
(they report glucose values in capillary plasma); *** plasma glucose is preferred in people with symptoms 
who are suspected of having type 1 diabetes 
TREATMENT GOAL IN DIABETES 
HbA1c of 7.0% 
OR 
Fasting PG value of 7.0 mmol/l ( 126mg/dl) 
AND ( if feasible) 
Postprandial PG value of 9.0 mmol/l (160 mg/dl)
