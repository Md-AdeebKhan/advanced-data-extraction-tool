in diabetes (lipid control) 
Lipid control 
• Some lipid profile improvement can be achieved with a 
healthy diet and physical activity. 
• Statins can reduce the risk of CVD events in people with 
diabetes. 
Antiplatelet treatment 
• Use of antiplatelet treatment only for secondary prevention 
of CVD events. 
• 75-100 mg of acetylsalicylic acid daily is recommended to all 
people with diabetes who have survived a CVD event and 
have no history of major bleeding 
Acute complications 
of diabetes 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia 
 
 
 
If the patient is able to eat and drink: •
 Give oral carbohydrate that contains 15-20 g of rapidly 
absorbing forms of glucose (sugar-sweetened soft drink, 1-2 
teaspoons of sugar, 5-6 hard candy, cup of milk) •
 Repeat the treatment if hypoglycaemia persists after 15 
minutes •
 If rapidly absorbing glucose is not available, any foods 
containing carbohydrate can be given (e.g. bread, rice, potato) •
 Follow by a small meal 
Management of hypoglycaemia – 
conscious patient 
  
Hypoglycaemia 
 
• Hypoglycaemia (abnormally low blood glucose) is a frequent 
complication in patients receiving sulfonylurea or insulin. 
• There is no universally agreed plasma glucose cut-off point for 
hypoglycaemia as symptoms and signs can occur at different 
thresholds. 
• It is most frequently defined at plasma glucose of <3.9 
mmol/l (70 mg/dl) when it should be managed even if there 
are no symptoms and signs. 
• Severe hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose <50 mg/dl or 2.8 
mmol/l) or appearance of signs 
• It can cause loss of consciousness and coma and is potentially 
life-threatening 
Management of hypoglycaemia- 
unconscious patient 
If patient is Unconscious, 
• If plasma glucose <=2.8mmol/l (50mg/dl ) and those unable 
to eat or ingest drink – give hypertonic glucose (dextrose) 
intravenously (20 – 50 ml of 50% glucose over 1-3 minutes. 
• If this concentration is not available, substitute with any 
hypertonic glucose solution 
• Food should be provided as soon as the patient is able to 
ingest food safely 
• Adjust medication if necessary 
• Educate the patient about conditions leading to hypoglycaemia 
  
Hyperglycaemic emergencies 
 
• Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar 
hyperglycaemic state (HHS) are life-threatening 
conditions 
• Severe hyperglycaemia- 
• Plasma glucose >18 mmol/l (325 mg/dl) and 
• Urine ketone 2+ or signs and 
• Symptoms of severe hyperglycaemia 
Symptoms and signs of 
hyperglycaemia (DKA and HHS) 
• Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain 
• Severe cases of DKA can present with Kussmaul’s 
breathing* 
• Changes in sensorium range from alertness to stupor or 
coma, depending on the severity 
• Patients with HHS typically present in stupor or coma 
*Kussmaul breathing: Air hunger, or rapid, deep, and 
labored breathing characteristic of patients with 
acidosis
