Acute complications of Diabetes 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA 
Hypoglycaemia (abnormally low blood glucose) is a frequent iatrogenic complication in diabetic patients, 
occurring particularly in patients receiving sulfonylurea or insulin. It can cause loss of consciousness and 
coma and is potentially life-threatening. 
There is no universally agreed plasma glucose cut-off point for hypoglycaemia as symptoms and signs 
can occur at different thresholds. It is most frequently defined at plasma glucose of <3.9 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) 
when it should be managed even if there are no symptoms and signs. 
Management of hypolycaemic emergencies 
Conscious patient: 
If the patient is able to eat and drink: 
• Give oral carbohydrate that contains 15-20 g of rapidly absorbing forms of glucose 
(sugar-sweetened soft drink, 1-2 teaspoons of sugar, 5-6 hard candy, cup of milk). 
• Plasma glucose levels typically increase by 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) within ~15 minutes; repeat the 
treatment if hypoglycaemia persists 
Unconscious patient: 
• Unconscious patients, those with plasma glucose <=2.8mmol/l (50mg/dl) and those unable to 
ingest drink should be given hypertonic glucose (dextrose) intravenously (20 – 50 ml of 50% 
glucose over 1-3 minutes. If this concentration is not available, substitute with any hypertonic 
glucose solution 
• Food should be provided as soon as the patient is able to ingest food safely 
• Discuss hypoglycaemia risk factors with the patient (skipping meals, physical activity more 
intense than usual, alcohol ingestion) and adjust medication if necessary 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA 
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) are life-threatening 
conditions with somewhat different features. 
Symptoms and signs of DKA and HHS 
• frequent symptoms of DKA are nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain 
• Severe cases of DKA can present with Kussmaul's breathing 
• Changes in sensorium in DKA range from alertness to stupor or coma, depending on the severity 
• Patients with HHS typically present in stupor or coma
