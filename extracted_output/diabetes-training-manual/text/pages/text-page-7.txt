• Control of glycaemia and blood pressure can slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy. 
• Specific treatment for the underlying nerve damage is not available 
Diabetic foot 
Patients can present with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and or peripheral artery occlusion. 
The absence of symptoms does not exclude diabetic foot problems. 
Examination 
All people with diabetes should have their feet examined at least once a year to assess risk. 
1. Examination of the feet for the following risk factors after removing the patient's shoes, socks, 
dressings and bandages: 
• Peripheral neuropathy 
- Pressure perception testing with 10g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament 
At least one other test of sensation (128Hz tuning fork vibration / cotton wisp /pin prick) and Achilles 
tendon reflexes 
• Peripheral arterial disease 
- Palpation of tibial posterior and dorsal pedal artery pulse, 
- Doppler ankle/brachial pressure index and toe-brachial pressure index if available 
• Presence of current or previous (healed) ulcer 
• Previous amputation 
• Presence of callus 
• Presence of deformity: claw toes, hammer toes, bony prominences; limited joint mobility 
• Presence of Charcot arthropathy: redness, warmth, swelling or deformity, particularly if skin is 
intact 
• Signs of infection or inflammation: at least two of redness, warmth, induration, tenderness, 
purulent secretion 
• Signs of gangrene 
 
Management of risk of diabetic foot problems 
• Patients with diabetes should receive education on avoidance of foot complications 
• Patients at low risk can be assessed annually, those at moderate risk every 3-6 months and those 
at high risk every 1-3 months 
• Pre-ulcerative lesions need to be treated by a trained professional: removal of callus, protecting or 
draining blisters, treatment of ingrown and thickened nails, antifungal treatment for fungal infections 
• Patients with gross foot deformities and/or absent peripheral pulses should be referred for further 
evaluation.
