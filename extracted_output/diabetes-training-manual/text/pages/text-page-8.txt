amputations have been achieved in settings with a multidisciplinary.

management by a trained professional and the necessary equipment and consumables are not 
available at the primary care level 
 
• Urgent referral to acute services is recommended for patients with any of the following: infected 
ulcer, spreading infection, critical limb ischaemia, gangrene, suspicion of acute Charcot arthropathy,
