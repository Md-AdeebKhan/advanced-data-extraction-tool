• Diabetic foot is one of the most common, costly 
and severe complications of diabetes 
• A diabetic foot ulcer is a localized injury to the 
skin and/or underlying tissue below the ankle. 
• Most diabetic foot ulcers are most often caused 
by trauma from inappropriate footwear and/or 
walking barefoot with insensitive feet. 
• Combined with reduced blood flow, neuropathy 
in the feet increases the chance of foot ulcers, 
infection and eventual need for limb amputation. 
 Symptoms of diabetic foot 
 
• Patients can present with symptoms and signs of 
peripheral neuropathy and/or peripheral artery 
occlusion and other risk factors for amputation 
• Symptoms are: 
• Intermittent claudication - pain in calves when walking, 
usually disappears in rest (occlusion in peripheral 
arteries) 
• symptoms of neuropathy 
The absence of symptoms does not exclude 
diabetic foot problems. 
Assessment and management of risk of active 
foot problems 
Examination of the feet 
• Remove the patient’s shoes, socks, dressings and 
bandages 
• Check for Peripheral neuropathy - 
• Pressure perception testing with 10g Semmes- 
Weinstein monofilament and 
• At least one other test of sensation ( 128Hz tuning fork 
vibration / cotton wisp /pin prick – see images) and 
• Achilles tendon reflexes 
  
Monofilament test 
 
Sensory examination should be carried out in a quiet and 
relaxed setting. 
Figure a: 
• First apply the monofilament on the patient’s hands (or 
elbow or forehead) so that she or he knows what to 
Sites for 
expect. 
monofilament test 
• The patient must not be able to see whether or where 
the examiner applies the filament. 
• The three sites to be tested on both feet are indicated in 
Figure 
• The total duration– skin contact and removal of the 
filament should be approx. 2 secs. 
• Apply the filament along the perimeter of not on an 
ulcer site callus or necrotic tissue. 
• Do not allow the filament to slide across the skin or make 
repetitive contact at the test site. 
  
Monofilament test (contd) 
 
• Apply the monofilament perpendicular to the skin surface. Apply sufficient 
force to cause the filament to bend or buckle. 
• Press the filament to the skin and ask the patient whether they feel the 
pressure applied (Yes/No) 
• Next, ask where they feel the pressure (right foot / left foot) 
• Repeat this application twice at the same site but alternate this with one 
“mock” application in which no filament is applied 
• So, in total three questions per site should be asked 
  
Palpation of arteries 
 
Palpation of dorsal pedis: 
• Feel in the middle of the dorsum of 
the foot just lateral to the tendon of 
extensor halluces longus (extensor 
tendon of the great toe) 
Posterior tibial artery: 
• Midway between medial malleolus 
and tendon calcaneus
