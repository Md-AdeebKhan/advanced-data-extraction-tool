Diabetes case studies with solutions 
Case study 1- Newly diagnosed diabetes 
A.B. is 42 years female having with no past medical history and presents with 3 months of 
fatigue, excessive thirst and frequent urination at night. How will you manage initially? 
History 
• Any other symptoms/complaints? 
• Diabetes in first-degree relatives? 
• Risk factors: e.g. unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, smoking history of gestational diabetes 
A.B. is otherwise healthy with no other symptoms. She is a non-smoker who leads a sedentary 
lifestyle. What would you examine and test? 
Physical examination 
• Blood pressure 
• BMI 
Biochemical tests 
• Fasting plasma glucose 
• Random plasma glucose is also an option because AB has symptoms, but it is a less sensitive test 
(will miss more cases than FPG) 
• Urine dipstick: glucose, protein, ketones, bacteria 
On examination, AB's BMI is 32 but there are nil other remarkable findings. BP 130/75. 
FPG is 9.6mmol/L (172.8MG/DL), urine dipstick shows glucose 2+, the rest is negative 
Any further examinations and/or tests? 
Physical examination 
• Examine feet to determine risk of foot complications or established presence of foot complications 
• Retinal exam (refer to ophthalmologist if a trained person is not available in the health facility) 
Biochemical tests 
• AB has diabetes. The positive diagnostic test does not need to be confirmed because she has 
symptoms of diabetes 
Foot exam shows low risk of foot complications. How do you manage the case? 
Intervention 
• Lifestyle education 
• Diet: healthy diet, low calorie intake to promote weight loss 
• Regular physical activity 
Medication 
• None 
Follow-up 
• Schedule for blood glucose control visit in 3 months
