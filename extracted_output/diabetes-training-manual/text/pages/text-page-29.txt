emergencies 
• DKA or HHS should be suspected in every ill patient with 
hyperglycaemia 
• Refer to hospital all patients with plasma glucose levels >= 
18 mmol/l (325 mg/dl) and all patients with suspected DKA 
or HHS 
• Infuse isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) at a rate of 1000 ml in 
the first 2 hours, continue with 1000ml every 4 hours until 
reaching hospital. 
• Hyperglycaemia slows gastric emptying and oral 
rehydration might not be effective, even in patients who 
are not vomiting 
  Correction of dehydration is the critical first step for transport.  
Specific Long- term 
Complications of Diabetes 
• Diabetic retinopathy 
• Diabetic nephropathy 
• Diabetic neuropathy 
• Diabetic foot 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Autonomic neuropathy 
• Sensory loss 
• Unpleasant sensation of 
burning, pain 
• Tingling or numbness 
• Hypoglycaemia 
• Orthostatic hypotension 
• Resting tachycardia 
• Diarrhoea, constipation and fecal 
incontinence 
• 
Erectile dysfunction 
• Urinary incontinence and bladder 
dysfunction 
Recommendations for early detection of 
diabetic retinopathy 
• Good control of glycaemia as well as blood pressure and 
dyslipidaemia can slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy and 
macular edema 
• People with type 2 diabetes should be screened for retinopathy by a 
trained person upon diagnosis and every 2 years thereafter 
• Visual acuity 
• Direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy or retinal fundus photography, 
after dilating the pupils 
• Patients reporting vision loss at any visit and those who have not had 
a retinal exam in more than 2 years should be referred to an 
ophthalmologist. 
• Referral to an ophthalmologist is recommended if screening by a 
trained person is not available in primary care 
  
Diabetic nephropathy 
 
Definition 
Diabetic nephropathy is aa clinical syndrome defined by albuminuria* 
characterized by a relentless decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 
raised arterial blood pressure and high risk of CVD & death 
Risk factors for kidney changes 
• genetic susceptibility 
• poor glycaemic control 
• elevated blood pressure 
Signs and symptoms of diabetic nephropathy 
• The first symptom of diabetic nephropathy is usually peripheral edema, 
but this occurs at a very late stage 
• The first clinical sign of diabetic nephropathy is moderately increased 
urine albumin excretion (microalbuminuria: 30–300 mg/24 h, or an 
albumin/creatinine ratio 30–300 mg/g). 
*(albuminuria in at least 2 of 3 consecutive samples > 300 mg/24 h, or 
albumin/creatinine ratio of> 300 mg/g) 
Recommendations for early detection of 
diabetic nephropathy 
• Control of glycaemia and blood pressure can slow the 
progression of diabetic nephropathy. 
• Aim for good glycaemic control but adjust for hypoglycaemia risk 
• Once a year monitor the albumin/creatinine ratio in a spot urine 
sample and serum creatinine for screening of CKD 
• If measurement of the albumin/creatinine ratio is not available, 
test for proteinuria (preferably with strips that specifically 
measure lower concentrations of albumin). 
• Maintain blood pressure levels at <130/80 mmHg with a thiazide 
diuretic and an ACE-inhibitor 
• Modify other major CVD risk factors (dyslipidaemia, smoking) 
  
Diabetic neuropathy 
 
Definition 
• Nerve damage or degeneration in diabetes is a group of disorders with diverse 
clinical manifestations like sensory and disorders of autonomic nervous system. 
Risk factors 
• Duration of diabetes, Poor glycaemic control 
• Age, Hypertension , Obesity 
Signs and symptoms of diabetic neuropathy 
Recommendations for management of diabetic 
neuropathy 
• Specific treatment for the underlying nerve damage is not 
available 
• If possible, exclude causes of peripheral neuropathy other 
than diabetes (alcohol, chemotherapy, vitamin B12 
deficiency, hypothyroidism, renal disease, malignancies, HIV 
infection) 
• Refer patients with painful peripheral neuropathy to 
specialized care for pharmacological management of pain 
• Refer patients with suspected autonomic neuropathy to 
specialized care 
• Improve glycaemic and blood pressure control
